# Quick Start Guide - Sleep Health Analysis

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Environment Setup ✅
Your Python environment is already configured! The following packages are installed:
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, jupyter

### Step 2: Open the Analysis Notebook 📊
1. Open `sleep_health_analysis.ipynb` in VS Code
2. Select the Python kernel (.venv)
3. Run all cells by clicking "Run All" or use Ctrl+F5

### Step 3: Explore the Results 🔍
The notebook contains 12 comprehensive sections:

1. **Data Loading** - Import libraries and load dataset
2. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values and explore data structure
3. **Feature Engineering** - Create age groups, activity levels, sleep categories
4. **Descriptive Statistics** - Calculate averages by occupation and age
5. **Correlation Analysis** - Find relationships between variables
6. **Sleep vs Occupation** - Bar charts showing job-related sleep patterns
7. **Sleep Disorder Distribution** - Pie charts of disorder prevalence
8. **Stress vs Sleep Disorders** - Stacked bars showing stress impact
9. **Physical Activity Analysis** - Scatter plots with regression lines
10. **Correlation Heatmap** - Comprehensive correlation matrix
11. **Age Group Analysis** - Multi-chart age-related insights
12. **Key Insights Summary** - Actionable conclusions and recommendations

### Step 4: Review Key Findings 💡
After running the analysis, you'll see:
- Which occupations get the best/worst sleep
- How stress levels correlate with sleep disorders
- The relationship between physical activity and sleep quality
- Age-related sleep patterns and disorder risks
- Data-driven recommendations for sleep improvement

### Step 5: Customize & Extend 🛠️
You can modify:
- Age group categories (currently: 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+)
- Activity level thresholds (currently: <5000, 5000-8000, >8000 steps)
- Sleep quality categories (currently: Poor ≤4, Fair 5-6, Good 7-8, Excellent 9+)
- Add new visualizations or analysis sections

## 🎯 What You'll Learn
- **Data Science Skills:** Loading, cleaning, and analyzing health data
- **Visualization Techniques:** Creating meaningful charts with matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation analysis and descriptive statistics
- **Health Insights:** Understanding factors that influence sleep quality
- **Business Intelligence:** Translating data into actionable recommendations

## 📊 Sample Insights You'll Discover
- 📈 Average sleep duration: ~7.13 hours
- 🏢 Sleep varies significantly by occupation (up to 2+ hour difference)
- 😰 People with sleep disorders have ~2 points higher stress levels
- 🏃‍♂️ Physical activity shows measurable correlation with sleep quality
- 👥 Different age groups show distinct sleep disorder patterns

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
**If cells don't run:**
1. Make sure you selected the correct Python kernel (.venv)
2. Install missing packages: Run the package installation cell
3. Restart kernel: Kernel → Restart in VS Code

**If visualizations don't show:**
1. Make sure plotly is installed
2. Try running cells individually
3. Check for any error messages in cell outputs

## 🎉 Next Steps
1. **Run the complete analysis** - Execute all notebook cells
2. **Review the insights** - Read the final summary section
3. **Create presentation** - Use findings for PowerPoint/reports
4. **Extend analysis** - Add your own research questions
5. **Share results** - Export charts from the `/visuals` folder
