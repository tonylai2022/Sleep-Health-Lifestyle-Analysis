- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- **Key Techniques:**
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Correlation analysis
  - Data visualization
  - Feature engineering (age groups, activity levels)

### Slide 5: Sleep Duration by Occupation - Key Finding #1
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Horizontal bar chart showing average sleep by occupation
- **Key Insights:**
  - Highest sleep duration: Engineer (7.99 hours)
  - Lowest sleep duration: Sales Representative (5.90 hours)
  - Range variation: 2.09 hours difference
- **Implication:** Career choice significantly impacts sleep patterns - Engineers get 35% more sleep than Sales Representatives

### Slide 6: Sleep Disorder Distribution - Key Finding #2
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Pie chart showing disorder prevalence
- **Key Statistics:**
  - 58.6% with no disorders (219 people)
  - 20.6% with Insomnia (77 people)
  - 20.9% with Sleep Apnea (78 people)
- **Insight:** 41.4% of population reports sleep disorders - a significant health concern

### Slide 7: Stress vs Sleep Disorders - Key Finding #3
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Stacked bar chart showing stress levels by disorder type
- **Key Insights:**
  - Average stress with disorders: 5.8/10
  - Average stress without disorders: 5.1/10
  - Stress difference: 0.7 points higher for disorder groups
- **Finding:** Higher stress strongly correlates with sleep disorder presence - Insomnia shows highest stress (5.9/10)

### Slide 8: Physical Activity & Sleep - Key Finding #4
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Scatter plot with regression line (Daily Steps vs Sleep Duration)
- **Statistics:**
  - Correlation coefficient: -0.040 (weak negative)
  - High Activity level: 7.16h average sleep
  - Average daily steps: 6,817 steps
- **Insight:** Physical activity level matters more than step count - High Activity people get best sleep quality

### Slide 9: Correlation Matrix - Comprehensive View
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Heatmap showing all variable correlations
- **Strongest Correlations:**
  - Sleep Duration ‚Üî Quality of Sleep: 0.883 (very strong)
  - Stress Level ‚Üî Sleep Quality: -0.899 (very strong negative)
  - Physical Activity ‚Üî Daily Steps: 0.773 (strong)
- **Key Takeaway:** Stress is the strongest predictor of poor sleep quality and duration

### Slide 10: Age Group Analysis - Key Finding #5
**Content:**
- **Chart:** Grouped bar chart showing sleep patterns by age
- **Key Insights:**
  - Best sleeping age group: 50-59 years (7.63h average)
  - Highest disorder prevalence: 40-49 years (64.1%)
  - Age-related sleep duration trends: Sleep improves with age until 50s
- **Finding:** Middle-aged adults (40-49) face highest sleep disorder risk, while older adults (50-59) sleep best

### Slide 11: Key Insights Summary
**Content:**
- **üè¢ Occupation Impact:** Engineers sleep 35% longer than Sales Reps; 2.09-hour variation between careers
- **üò∞ Stress Management:** Strong negative correlation (-0.811) with sleep; 0.7 points higher in disorder groups
- **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Physical Activity:** High activity level yields best sleep (7.16h); step count has weak correlation
- **üë• Age Patterns:** 40-49 age group has highest disorder risk (64.1%); 50-59 group sleeps best (7.63h)
- **üîó Key Correlations:** Stress (-0.899), Sleep Quality (0.883), Physical Activity (0.212)

### Slide 12: Actionable Recommendations
**Content:**
**For Individuals:**
- High-stress occupations (Sales, Science): Focus on stress reduction techniques
- Target high physical activity levels (not just step counts) 
- Age 40-49: Prioritize sleep disorder prevention
- Monitor stress levels - strongest predictor of sleep problems

**For Healthcare Providers:**
- Screen patients in high-risk occupations (Sales Rep, Scientist, Teacher)
- Focus interventions on 40-49 age group (64.1% disorder rate)
- Emphasize stress management as primary intervention
- Use occupation as sleep disorder risk factor

**For Employers:**
- Engineers/Lawyers show best sleep patterns - study their work conditions
